                     <P>Title: Thr Tomorrow war</P>
                     <p>Actors: Chris Pratt, Betty and Simmons.</p>

                     <P> The world is stunned when a group of time travellers arrive from the year 2051 to deliver an urgent message: thirty years in the future, mankind is losing a global war against a deadly alien species.
                     Dan receives a notice that he has been drafted and when he tells his wife, she says they should run and talks Dan into visiting his estranged father, a mechanical engineer, for help in removing the draft band attached to his arm.
                     Dan's father left him and his mother after he returned from the Vietnam War because he felt it was dangerous to remain with them, but Dan says he does not want his help and calls him a coward, then leaves. Dan reports to basic training with other draftees where they are briefed from future soldiers about the Whitespikes. Dan deduces with fellow draftee Charlie that to prevent a paradox, those drafted have already died before the war starts and those who have come from the future haven't been born yet.
                     hey debate telling the world about the problem, but decide to end the threat themselves. Once inside, they realize that the Whitespikes are not the aliens themselves, but rather bio-engineered organisms possibly used as a planet-clearing weapon or cattle by another alien race. The team injects five of the dormant Whitespikes with the toxin; this kills the injected ones but wakes the rest of the colony, and most of the team is killed. </P>
