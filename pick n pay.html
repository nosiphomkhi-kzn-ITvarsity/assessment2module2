                    <P>Pick n Pay is the second largest supermarket chain store in South Africa,
                     Its objective is to restore the business to a position of long-term sustainable growth. In promulgating the plan, the Group explained that a sustainable recovery would need to be achieved in a planned,
                     considered and balanced way over a number of years, avoiding short-term actions which might weaken the business in the longer term.  
                     Focus here is on delivering a first-class fresh, convenience and grocery offer, which gives customers unbeatable prices, value and service. The business is also developing a strong multiplatform and multi-channel retail offer,
                     including standalone clothing and liquor stores and a burgeoning online business. In addition, the Group aims to continue to build its Boxer business into a thriving national limited-range discount format, 
                     and to continue to grow sales outside South Africa in a planned and prudent way.</P>
                     <P>Pick n Pay is a retail business in the fast-moving consumer goods industry on the African continent that believes doing good is good business.
                      Pick n Pay operates through multiple store formats under two brands – Pick n Pay and Boxer – and we have the largest online grocery business in Africa</P>
